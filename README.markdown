# longmove.vim

Move more easily in buffers with long lines.

## Features

Currently, the plugin provides the maps `gH`, `gM`, and `gL` in normal, visual,
and operator-pending modes that work analogously to Vim's `H`, `M`, and `L`.

## Installation

The plugin works with the major plugin managers. For instance with
[vim-plug][plug] just place in your `.vimrc`:

    Plug 'riceissa/vim-longmove'

## License

Distributed under the same terms as Vim itself. See `:help license`.
