Doing something like `0vgLgjgjgjgMgL` on a really long line gets the final
position wrong. As far as I can tell, this is because of Vim's handling of
`gv` when the initial position is hidden and you're on a really long line.

I don't think there's a good way to go about fixing this, because we're
reaching the limits of what Vim can do to handle long lines.
