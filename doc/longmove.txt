                                                *longmove-gH*
gH                      To screen line [count] from top of window (default:
                        first screen line on the window) on the first non-blank
                        character. Respects 'startofline' and 'scrolloff'.
                        Unlike with |H|, in |Operator-pending-mode| this
                        movement acts |characterwise| rather than |linewise|,
                        as it wouldn't make sense to act linewise in truly
                        long lines.

                                                *longmove-gM*
gM                      To middle screen line of window, on the first non-blank
                        character. Respects 'startofline'.
                        Unlike with |M|, in |Operator-pending-mode| this
                        movement acts |characterwise| rather than |linewise|,
                        as it wouldn't make sense to act linewise in truly
                        long lines.

                                                *longmove-gL*
gL                      To screen line [count] from bottom of window (default:
                        last screen line on the window) on the first non-blank
                        character. Respects 'startofline' and 'scrolloff'.
                        Unlike with |L|, in |Operator-pending-mode| this
                        movement acts |characterwise| rather than |linewise|,
                        as it wouldn't make sense to act linewise in truly
                        long lines.
